### Most Prominent Factors in Video Game Popularity
1.    Problem Statement
We want to analyze data from thousands of different video games in order to find the factors that have the most effect on the popularity of a game. Possible factors include price, genre, and console type. Through our analysis of the data, we also wish to see which game types and consoles are most popular among gamers. Itâ€™s possible that the popularity of some game types are affected by different factors than that of other game types, so we also wish to find out how the popularity of specific genres are determined.
2.   Significance of the Problem
As previously stated, the video game market is extremely profitable. However, designing a video game requires countless hours of work, so being able to predict the success of a game ahead of time will be a great help to video game developers. Another possibility is that companies can design a pricing strategy based on the prices and popularity of similar games. This will allow companies to sell their games at more ideal prices which will help to generate more profit.
